I am (soon to be) Science Manager at Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft e.V. (DFG) and Political Scientist. 

My will focus on the promotion of Digital Expertise in the sciences and Open Science in general.

My research interests are:

- Judicial Politics, Judicial Behaviour, and Judicial Public Relations
- Political Communication
- Policy Agenda Dynamics
- Political Institutions

I am also interested in novel developments in methodologies, such as automated text analysis and various applications of big data in political research.
