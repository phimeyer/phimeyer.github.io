I am a Programme Officer at German Research Foundation (DFG), focusing on e-research technologies and the Digital Turn in Science and Research. 

As a Political Scientist by training, my research and my publications were focused on:

- Judicial Politics, Judicial Behaviour, and Judicial Public Relations
- Political Communication
- Policy Agenda Dynamics
- Political Institutions

Furthermore, I am interested in novel developments in methodologies, such as automated text analysis and various applications of big data in political research.
