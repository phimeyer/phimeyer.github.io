I am a Data Mining Manager at SAZ Services GmbH and Political Scientist. My research interests are:

- Judicial Politics, Judicial Behaviour, and Judicial Public Relations
- Political Communication
- Policy Agenda Dynamics
- Political Institutions

I am also interested in novel developments in methodologies, such as automated text analysis and various applications of big data in political research.
