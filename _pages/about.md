I am (soon to be) a Science Manager at German Research Foundation (DFG) focusing on e-research technologies and the Digital Turn in Science and Research. 

As a Political Scientist my research interests are:

- Judicial Politics, Judicial Behaviour, and Judicial Public Relations
- Political Communication
- Policy Agenda Dynamics
- Political Institutions

I am also interested in novel developments in methodologies, such as automated text analysis and various applications of big data in political research.
